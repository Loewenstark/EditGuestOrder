MageProfis_EditGuestOrder
=========================

When viewing a guest order in the Magento admin panel there is no built-in way to change the customers name or email address. This module offers a simple solution: The values are loaded in a form that is displayed as a modal dialogue. The data is saved via AJAX.

Compatibility
-------------

Untested, but should be working in:

- Magento >= 1.5
